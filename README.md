# Terabox Upload Tool

A simple and efficient Node.js library for uploading files and fetching file list from [TeraBox](https://www.terabox.com/wap) storage. This tool streamlines the process of file uploads while offering customization options such as directory selection.

## Features

* File Upload: Easily upload files to Terabox storage.
* Custom Directory Support: Specify the directory where the file should be uploaded.
* Progress Tracking: Monitor the upload progress in real-time.
* Fetch File List: Fetch file list from any directory.

## Coming Soon (Open for Collaboration)

* Fetch Files: Retrieve the resources download URL and add URL Path in JSON  object returned by exiting [fetchFileList() ](.\lib\index.js)method .
* Delete Files: Remove files from your Terabox storage directly using this library.

## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install terabox-upload-tool
```

## Getting Started

### Setting up credentials

```javascript
const TeraboxUploader = require('terabox-upload-tool');

const credentials = {
  ndus: 'valid_ndus', //Required: Get this from your session (See guide below)
  appId: 'valid_appId', //Get from session (See attached screenshots)
  uploadId: 'valid_uploadId' //Get from session (See attached screenshots)
};

```

### Uploading a File

To upload a file, create an instance of TeraboxUploader and specify the file path.

#### Example: Save File to a Specific Directory

```javascript
const uploader = new TeraboxUploader(credentials);

async function uploadFile() {
  try {
    const result = await uploader.uploadFile(filePath, showProgress, '/myUploads');
    if (result.success) {
      console.log('File uploaded successfully!');
      console.log('File details:', result.fileDetails);  
    } else {
      console.log('Upload failed:', result.message);  
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('An error occurred during the upload:', error.message); 
  }
}

```

#### Example: Fetch a list of files from Terabox

```javascript
async function fetchFileList() {
  try {
   const fileList=await uploader.fetchFileList('/myUploads');  
    console.log('Files in your directory:', fileList);  
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error fetching file list:', error.message); 
  }
}
```
